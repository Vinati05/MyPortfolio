I want a modern, professional, and unique personal portfolio website for Vinati Vege, a Computer Science and Engineering student from VNRVJIET (Batch of 2027, CGPA 9.01). The site should be designed not just as an online resume but as an interactive showcase of my skills, projects, and achievements that stands out to companies.
Core requirements:
Landing Page (Hero Section):
A bold tagline that reflects me as a backend engineer and AI/ML enthusiast.
A clean, minimalist background with subtle interactive elements (e.g., floating code snippets, animated abstract shapes, or a soft AI/data-inspired theme).
A quick call-to-action like “Explore My Work” or “Let’s Build Together.”
About Me Section:
A concise but engaging narrative about my passion for backend systems, AI-native development, and problem-solving.
A professional photo/illustration.
Keywords/skills displayed in a creative format (like an interactive skills cloud or animated skill bars).
Projects Showcase:
Not a simple list, but a visual, interactive gallery of my key projects (AI chatbot, Age & Gender Detection, VR game, E-commerce CMS, HarmonyHub).
Each project card opens into a detailed modal or page with tech stack, challenges, and impact.
Option to embed demos, GitHub links, or short video walkthroughs.
Experience Section:
Highlight internship at Partha Developers with a timeline-style design.
Show responsibilities visually (icons/graphics for backend, frontend, deployment).
Achievements & Research:
A dynamic section with badges or tiles for milestones like Top 50 in Turing Hut contest, ICDH research paper, TEDx host, cultural events, Toastmasters.
Should feel like a highlight reel rather than plain text.
Certifications & Skills:
Certifications shown as digital badges.
Skills represented in a creative way (radial charts, interactive filters like “Languages / Frameworks / Tools”).
Contact Section:
Professional but stylish. Email, LinkedIn, GitHub.
Optional embedded form.
Design guidelines:
Theme: Tech-modern with a futuristic edge (navy, dark blue, white accents, subtle gradients).
Layout: Clean grid, lots of breathing space, smooth transitions.
Rare factor: Something interactive or creative that most portfolios don’t have — for example:
A command-line inspired interface option where recruiters can “type” commands like projects or resume to explore.
Or a data-driven timeline where my journey is visualized interactively.
Fully responsive for mobile and desktop.
Goal:
The website should not only present my profile but leave a strong impression by combining professionalism with a rare, innovative presentation style. It should make recruiters remember me as someone who builds with creativity, precision, and forward-thinking design.








Tagline:
Backend engineer in the making, exploring AI and building things that matter.
